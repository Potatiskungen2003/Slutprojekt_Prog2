### Code conventions

__File organisation:__ The code is divided into different files, by order of functions, for easier interaction and to facilitate contributions.

__Naming convention:__ All the files use __snake_case__ for variable names.

__Comments:__ One-line comments are written above the code line to explain the code and its purpose. The same principle applies to block comments.
